"""Catalog-driven regression for the channel mapping manager.

For every committed ``modem.expected.json`` in the catalog, drive the
data through ``build_channel_map`` in both NUMBER and ID modes.  This
closes the seam between Core's parser output and HA's mapping layer:
``intake_pipeline_regression`` validates HAR -> parser; this validates
parser -> ``build_channel_map``.

A new modem with a parser whose output shape differs from the rest of
the catalog (e.g., omits ``lock_status``) will surface here before it
ships, instead of crashing setup on a user's hardware.

See CHANNEL_IDENTIFICATION_SPEC.md.
